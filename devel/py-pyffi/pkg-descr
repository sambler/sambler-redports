The Python File Format Interface is an open source Python library
for processing block structured binary files:

Simple: Reading, writing, and manipulating complex binary files in a
Python environment is easy! Currently, PyFFI supports the
NetImmerse/Gamebryo NIF and KFM formats, CryTekâ€™s CGF format,
the FaceGen EGM format, the DDS format, and the TGA format.
Batteries included: Many tools for files used by 3D games, such as
optimizers, stripifier, tangent space calculator, 2d/3d hull algorithms,
inertia calculator, as well as a general purpose file editor
QSkope (using PyQt4), are included.
Modular: Its highly modular design makes it easy to add support for
new formats, and also to extend existing functionality.
