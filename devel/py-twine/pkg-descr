Twine is a utility for interacting with PyPI.
The biggest reason to use twine is that it securely authenticates
you to PyPI over HTTPS using a verified connection.

Features -
- Verified HTTPS Connections
- Uploading doesnâ€™t require executing setup.py
- Uploading files that have already been created, allowing testing 
   of distributions before release
- Supports uploading any packaging format (including wheels).
