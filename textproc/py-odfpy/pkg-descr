Odfpy is a library to read and write OpenDocument v. 1.2 files.
The main focus has been to prevent the programmer from creating
invalid documents. It has checks that raise an exception if the
programmer adds an invalid element, adds an attribute unknown
to the grammar, forgets to add a required attribute or adds
text to an element that doesnâ€™t allow it.
