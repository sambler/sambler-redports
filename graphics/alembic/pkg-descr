Alembic is an open computer graphics interchange framework. Alembic distills
complex, animated scenes into a non-procedural, application-independent set
of baked geometric results.

Alembic is focused on efficiently storing the computed results of complex
procedural geometric constructions. It is very specifically NOT concerned
with storing the complex dependency graph of procedural tools used to
create the computed results.
