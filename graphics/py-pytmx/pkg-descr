PyTMX is a map loader for python/pygame designed for games.
It provides smart tile loading with a fast and efficient storage base.
Not only does it correctly handle most Tiled object types, it also
will load metadata for them so you can modify your maps and objects
in Tiled instead of modifying your source code.
